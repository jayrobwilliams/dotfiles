# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

They are largely adapted from https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles with many of the web development components swapped out for more data science-oriented ones.

It mainly targets macOS systems, but it works on at least Ubuntu as well.

## Highlights

- Minimal efforts to install everything, using a [Makefile](./Makefile)
- Mostly based around Homebrew, Caskroom and Node.js, latest Bash + GNU Utils
- Fast and colored prompt, including git repo and conda environment information
- Updated macOS defaults
- Well-organized and easy to customize
- Supports both Apple Silicon (M1) and Intel chips

## Packages Overview

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (packages: [Brewfile](./install/Brewfile))
- [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) (packages: [Caskfile](./install/Caskfile))
- Latest Git, Bash, Python 3, GNU coreutils, curl
- Mamba (Conda) installed from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)
- `$EDITOR` (and Git editor) is [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jayrobwilliams/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download, this repo to `~/.dotfiles` depending on the availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`.

1. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything [listed above](#package-overview), and symlink [runcom](./runcom)
and [config](./config) (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```

The installation process in the Makefile is tested on every push and every week in this
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/actions).

## Post-Installation

- `dotfiles dock` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh))
- `dotfiles macos` (set [macOS defaults](./macos/defaults.sh))
- Mackup
  - Log in to Dropbox (and wait until synced)
  - `ln -s ~/.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg ~` (until [#632](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/632) is fixed)
  - `mackup restore`

## The `dotfiles` command

```bash
$ dotfiles help
Usage: dotfiles <command>

Commands:
    clean            Clean up caches (brew, npm, gem, rvm)
    dock             Apply macOS Dock settings
    edit             Open dotfiles in IDE (code) and Git GUI (stree)
    help             This help message
    macos            Apply macOS system defaults
    test             Run tests
    update           Update packages and pkg managers (OS, brew, npm, gem)
```

## Customize

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from
`.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`. The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all
`~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
